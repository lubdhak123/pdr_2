## VI. Trust Intelligence & Forensic Flags (Layer 2)
| Feature Name               | Data Type | Description/Logic                                                       |

### Implementation Note for PDR

For your **Data Engineering** phase, ensure you handle the **Boolean Flags** separately. In XGBoost, these flags should have a high **Feature Importance** weight because a `1` in `identity_device_mismatch` or `p2p_circular_loop_flag` should override even the best "Revenue Growth."

Would you like me to help you write the **Data Cleaning script** that handles the missing values for NTC users (who won't have the MSME features) so your model doesn't crash?
